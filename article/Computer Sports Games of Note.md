Computer Sports Games of Note
=============================

*   schema: Video game

This is a list of computer sports games
[of note](A%20Note%20on%20Items%20of%20Note.md).

I'm not generally a huge fan of sports games.
These are recognizably about a sport, but
could not be described as "conventional".

For "computer game" see Computer Games of Note,
but note that in this instance it does include
[video games](Video%20Games%20of%20Note.md).

### Cool Boarders 2

It's only barely realistic â€” for example,
there is clearly no limit to the amount of spin you can impart to your
jump. The longer you keep holding X and right, the more rotational velocity
you'll have when you catch air. Whee! And it has a soundtrack that can't be
beat.

### Super Dodge Ball

Because what dodgeball game is complete without the ability to
actually *kill* your opponents?  Not to mention some of the
players are literally giants.

The basketball game where you are the basketball and you bounce off
the other player, who is also a basketball.

This was a type-in game that appeared in
[Compute! Gazette Issue 49](https://archive.org/details/1987-07-computegazette),
July 1987.

It took me a long time to locate this game again.

Basically it was a darts game.  Your player stands on the right, the
dartboard is on the left, and you threw the dart in an arc and hoped
to hit the dartboard.

It was meant to be played with a paddle, but it was also playable
with an analog joystick, which leads to the "smash your thumb" technique
for a perfect dart launch, which I will describe here at some point.

### Atomic Handball

Certainly a contender for Best Premise: it's the year 2040 and
all major sports have been replaced by the exciting _Atomic Handball!_
