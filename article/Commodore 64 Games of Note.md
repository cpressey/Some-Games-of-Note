### Street Surfer

In the mid-80's, when skateboarding became popular, a rash of such games
appeared: Skate or Die, Skate Rock, and so forth.  But this one made all
of those look quite banal.

For one thing, Street Surfer was probably one of the first games based on
recycling.  The object is to collect and recycle as many glass bottles as
possible.

Also notable for the fact that you could, on a skateboard, outpace cars on a
highway.

Also notable for the fact that the theme music changes tempo to match your
speed.

### Fire Ant

Once I got used to the "tight handling" of the protagonist with the joystick,
I liked this game a lot.  The premise is cute.  Each level introduces new
things which you don't know what they do, and is not just a combination of
known mechanisms.

### Whistler's Brother

Notable for gameplay mechanic: the player controls one character directly
with a joystick, but also a second character indirectly, by influencing
where they go, by whistling for them.

However, despite this interesting mechanic, I must admit I never really
got into this game.  Something about it failed to appeal to me — perhaps
it was that the graphics felt kind of uninspired.

### Slinky

This one's pretty memorably weird, and deserves comment.

Once upon a time there was a game called Q*Bert which was quite famous and inspired a number of clones,
and each of these clones tended to have their own idiosyncratic mechanics.  And Slinky is one such clone.

The 2013-06-14 comment by zaphod77 on the Lemon64 entry linked to above explains those mechanics far
better than I could.  It does not, however, help them seem less arbitrary.  I don't think anything
could do that.
