Beautiful graphics.  I believe the antagonists were implemented with "soft sprites"
(groups of programmable characters), so that all(?) 8 hardware sprites were free to
be used for the protagonist in a composite fashion that is both hi-res and
multicolour.  The music is also good.  The game itself is quite hard.

### Street Surfer

In the mid-80's, when skateboarding became popular, a rash of such games
appeared: Skate or Die, Skate Rock, and so forth.  But this one made all
of those look quite banal.

For one thing, Street Surfer was probably one of the first games based on
recycling.  The object is to collect and recycle as many glass bottles as
possible.

Also notable for the fact that you could, on a skateboard, outpace cars on a
highway.

Also notable for the fact that the theme music changes tempo to match your
speed.

### Pharaoh's Curse

It's difficult to say what contributes to this game's overall charm.

You can shoot the mummy, but the mummy can shoot back.

The triggers trigger traps on a delay which is perfectly predictable, so it
adds a nice element of timing to the game.

Also: the bird!

### Fire Ant

Once I got used to the "tight handling" of the protagonist with the joystick,
I liked this game a lot.  The premise is cute.  Each level introduces new
things which you don't know what they do, and is not just a combination of
known mechanisms.

### Necromancer

It's a good example of a game which combines fast-pacing with variety
while maintaining coherence across the variety.  The Wikipedia article
explains it better than I can.

### Whistler's Brother

Notable for gameplay mechanic: the player controls one character directly
with a joystick, but also a second character indirectly, by influencing
where they go, by whistling for them.

However, despite this interesting mechanic, I must admit I never really
got into this game.  Something about it failed to appeal to me — perhaps
it was that the graphics felt kind of uninspired.

### Zeppelin

Notable because you can shoot out bits of wall, or rather, bits of force field
and Futuristic Domed City, and in this way it feels a bit like an airborne
version of [Cloak & Dagger][].  Also notable because it involves flying a
dirigible in a cave.

Also notable for being a multi-directional scroller, but one in which you have
only limited influence over which direction it scrolls in.  Once you maneouver
to a particular point in the cave, the direction will change apropos to that
point.  You don't seem to be able to get into a dead-end this way, which is
probably good (much less frustrating than games in which you can,) but you
do seem to be able to go in circles quite easily.

### Slinky

This one's pretty memorably weird, and deserves comment.

Once upon a time there was a game called Q*Bert which was quite famous and inspired a number of clones,
and each of these clones tended to have their own idiosyncratic mechanics.  And Slinky is one such clone.

The 2013-06-14 comment by zaphod77 on the Lemon64 entry linked to above explains those mechanics far
better than I could.  It does not, however, help them seem less arbitrary.  I don't think anything
could do that.
