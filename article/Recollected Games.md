Recollected Games
=================

*   schema: Recollected game
*   status: permanently under construction

These are games which are possibly not remarkable enough nor classic enough
to be put in one of the other lists, but which I have memories of playing
(or at least seeing) regardless, and I'd like to note those memories somewhere.

This list is kind of a grab bag and will possibly never be as well organized
as the other lists.  There is a good chance any particular entry here will
move to some other list.

Commodore 64
------------

Some of these aren't totally Commodore 64-specific, and had conversions
on (or were a conversion from) other systems.

### Starquake

*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=2470)

Perhaps a C64 classic, but perhaps not well-known enough to be a true classic.

The graphics are really good.

### Paradroid

*   wikipedia: [Paradroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradroid)
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=1888)

Very likely a C64 classic.

### The Castles of Dr. Creep

*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=428)

This is more of a puzzle game than a video game.

### Spindizzy

*   wikipedia: [Spindizzy (video game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindizzy_(video_game))
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=2419)

According to Wikipedia, the game was originally released for the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC,
then later ported to other systems.

### Zig Zag

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.lemon64.com/games%252Fscreenshots%252Ffull%252Fz%252Fzig_zag_04.gif)

*   wikipedia: N/A
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=2943)

Not to be confused with a different game called Zig Zag, also for the C64.

### Big Mac: The Mad Maintenance Man

### Everyone's a Wally

If there was an award for Best Representation of a British High Street in an 8-bit Video Game,
this would be a contender.  It's worth noting that "being a wally" is British slang for
"being a fool" (approximately speaking).

There were also versions for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC but it's not clear to me
if the Commodore 64 version was a later port or if they were developed simultaneously.

### Ultimate Wizard

Obviously influenced by Jumpman.  Jumpman with spells and a construction
kit, really.

### Cauldron II

Well, it's got a dinosaur in a bathtub, that's for sure.

### Equinox

The internet thinks the [theme music for this game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Of28GGPUIY) was written
by Nick Jones, the main(?) developer of the C64 version of this game.  This is entirely possible.

However, I swear I've also heard this song on radio/muzak while I was in Paris, twice.  French synthpop?

It's entirely possible it was merely a similar tune, or that they are the same song but which came first?

Game-wise, it's an okay game.

Commodore 64 Type-Ins

### Crossroads

*   available for: Commodore 64
*   date released: 1987
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=4094)

This was a type-in game that appeared in
[Compute! Gazette Issue 54](https://archive.org/details/1987-12-computegazette),
December 1987.

This is possibly one of the best type-in games to ever have appeared in a magazine.

### Lava Flow

This was a type-in game that appeared in
[Compute! Gazette Issue 63](https://archive.org/details/1988-09-computegazette),
September 1988.

It's interesting because the lava works like a cellular automaton, a bit.

Didn't realize "bovver" was "bother" until I was older.

Need a Llamasoft section.

### Congo Bongo

*   entry @ [atarimania](http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-5200-congo-bongo_s11727.html)

Here is what is notable about Congo Bongo: the arcade game uses
[isometric projection][], but the C64 conversion and other
conversions use [oblique projection][], while the SG-1000
conversion uses [orthographic projection][], i.e. "side view",
i.e. it's just plain two-dimensional.

Which raises the aesthetic question: at what point does the game stop being Congo Bongo?

An omnidirectional scroller in space where you get to
shoot out the spherical pods of those [Benzene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene)-shaped
space stations.

The first arcade game to offer a "continue?" option, apparently.

### Bomb Jack

I thought this was called "Superguy".

I remember seeing this at the Greyhound station in Winnipeg — back when it
was located in the downtown, and back when it had a shop with a whole row
of arcade machines in it.  This is also where I first saw Super Mario
Brothers, fwiw.

Notable because — well, it was a top-down view, which was truly top-down;
you saw the top of the protagonist's head, not their rear or side profile.
On top of that, you could jump.  On top of that, IIRC, you could change
direction while jumping.  So, while running southest, you could jump over
an obstacle such as a rock, and then while over the rock, you could move
northeast, then west, then east, then finally land north of the rock.
And this seemed more like lax game design and/or programming, than anything
intentional, but who knows.

### Bubbles

I thought it was cute when I saw it.

### Burgertime


### Reactor


### Scramble

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.arcade-museum.com/images%252F118%252F1181242158130.png)

*   published by: Konami

*   entry @ [arcade-museum.com](https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9447)

in which bombing the enemy's fuel tanks somehow results in you having *more* fuel.
This game mechanic would certainly be ridiculed as a "lack of realism" if this game
were written today. But the fact is, suspension of disbelief is suspension of disbelief,
and it keeps the game moving.

### Cloak & Dagger

*   genre: Shoot-'em-Up
*   available for: Arcade
*   controls: dual joystick
*   wikipedia: [Cloak & Dagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloak_%26_Dagger_(video_game))
*   video @ [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OryQRZ6Ez8)

There's something that's always attracted me about being able to shoot out
bits of wall. The boxes and conveyor belts hold a similar draw. Not sure if
I can put my finger on exactly what it is, though.

I remember seeing this at a 7-11 near where my sister was living at the time.

Notable for the fact that there was a tie-in with the movie of the same name,
which featured a home console (Atari 5200) version of this game... which was
never finished, despite the fact that the movie was a commercial success.

### Mr. Do

*   available for: Arcade
*   controls: joystick and one button

This is probably a classic.

### Gorf

This is probably a classic.

### Wizard of Wor

This is probably a classic.

### Cyberbykes

*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbykes

I remember discovering a secret area you could jump to on one level (I think it
was "Warwickshire"?), but I don't remember if I ever successfully jumped to it...

### Stunts

### Pinball Fantasies (?)

### Katamari Damacy

*   published by: Namco
*   genre: Maze-Runner (nominally)
*   available for: Sony PlayStation
*   controls: dual analog joystick
*   wikipedia: [Katamari Damacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy)

An extremely original game — sort of a four-dimensional maze game where the
fourth dimension is scale. Rolling things up is also surprisingly satisfying
and disturbingly addictive. To top it all off, the soundtrack can't be beat.

### Super Monkey Ball 2

*   genre: Maze-Runner
*   available for: Nintendo GameCube
*   controls: analog joystick
*   wikipedia: [Super Monkey Ball 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball_2)

I didn't think I'd like this one, since I really don't like those wooden
mazes that you tilt with the two dials — which is essentially what this
game is. But somehow it manages to be fun. Especially when you start
barrelling down a spiral, completely out of control. The party games I could
mostly do without, with the exception of racing, which is at least as fun
as the main game.

Some students had borrowed a video projector from the lab, and hooked it
up to their GameCube.  I played this on it, projected on the wall.
IMAX style.  It was vertigo-inducing.
