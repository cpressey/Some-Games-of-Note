Recollected Games
=================

*   schema: Recollected game

These are games which are possibly not remarkable enough nor classic enough
to be put in one of the other lists, but which I have memories of playing
(or at least seeing) regardless, and I'd like to note those memories somewhere.

This list is kind of a grab bag and will possibly never be as well organized
as the other lists.  There is a good chance any particular entry here will
move to some other list.

Commodore 64
------------

Some of these aren't totally Commodore 64-specific, and had conversions
on (or were a conversion from) other systems.

### Paradroid

*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=1888)
*   wikipedia: [Paradroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradroid)

It's a C64 classic.  This did eventually get converted to other systems, but
not "the usual contemporaries" of the C64; Wikipedia treats it as "a C64 game" rather than
"an 8-bit game with ports C64 and other systems".

### The Castles of Dr. Creep

This is more of a puzzle game than a video game.

### Hovver Bovver

Didn't realize "bovver" was "bother" until I was older.

Need a Llamasoft section.

Holy cow.  I remember this game!

### Congo Bongo

![screenshot: SG-1000](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.retrogames.cz/games%252F176%252FSG1000_01.gif)

*   available for: Arcade
*   date released: 1983
*   entry @ [atarimania](http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-5200-congo-bongo_s11727.html)
*   published by: Sega
*   wikipedia: [Congo Bongo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Bongo)

Here is what is notable about Congo Bongo: the arcade game uses
[isometric projection][], but the C64 conversion and other
conversions use [oblique projection][], while the SG-1000
conversion uses [orthographic projection][], i.e. "side view",
i.e. it's just plain two-dimensional.

Which raises the aesthetic question: at what point does the game stop being Congo Bongo?

### Cyberbykes

*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbykes

I remember discovering a secret area you could jump to on one level (I think it
was "Warwickshire"?), but I don't remember if I ever successfully jumped to it...

### Stunts

Worth noting.

### Magic Carpet

*   published by: Bullfrog

Worth noting.

### Pinball Fantasies

Not sure if worth noting.

### King's Quest V

*   authors: Roberta Williams et al.
*   date released: 1990
*   genre: Point-and-click adventure
*   subtitle: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!
*   wikipedia: [King's Quest V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_V)

Alexander takes a mint.

This game is fairly well written, which is in stark contrast to the other games
in the King's Quest series, which are simply painful.

If, however, you like things that are so bad that they are absurdly bad (and
considering what website you're visiting, that's not unlikely,) King's Quest IV
has moments of morbidity that may make it worthwhile: Graham's scream as he
falls off the icy cliffs, and the narrator's jesting about "dying for a drink."
But don't even try playing the endgame without a walkthrough.

Console / 16-bit and above
--------------------------

### Katamari Damacy

*   available for: Sony PlayStation
*   controls: dual analog joystick
*   genre: Maze-Runner (nominally)
*   published by: Namco
*   wikipedia: [Katamari Damacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy)

An extremely original game — sort of a four-dimensional maze game where the
fourth dimension is scale. Rolling things up is also surprisingly satisfying
and disturbingly addictive. To top it all off, the soundtrack can't be beat.

### Typhoon Thompson

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.atarimagazines.com/st-log%252Fissue29%252F35-3.jpg)

*   available for: Amiga 500, Atari ST
*   controls: mouse and keyboard
*   date released: 1988
*   genre: Shoot-'em'-Up (nominally)
*   published by: Brøderbund
*   wikipedia: [Typhoon Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Thompson)
*   written by: Dan Gorlin

Quite possibly the cutest game ever.

Not actually a shoot-'em-up, as the author pointed out in his interview for
[Halcyon Days](http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/GORLIN.HTM):

> I like it because it's unique, the gameplay is simple but infinitely
> variable, and for me the characters really come to life. Some people
> mistook it for a shooter at the time, but it's really more like a game
> of Blitzkrieg Chess. If you just start blasting you lose immediately.
> Each kind of enemy has moves it can make, and the player has his moves,
> but things never happen the same way twice. It's not high concept in
> the way that "Choplifter" is, but rather a kind of art piece.

### Llamatron

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.atarimania.com/st%252Fscreens%252Fllamatron_llamasoft_6.gif)

*   available for: Atari ST, Amiga, MS-DOS
*   controls: joystick and 1 button
*   date released: 1991
*   genre: Shoot-'em'-Up
*   wikipedia: [Llamatron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llamatron)
*   written by: Jeff Minter

Fast-paced, psychedaelic, mindless fun, like most Jeff Minter games.
Basically a clone of the arcade game Robotron, but with shaggy, smelly
quadrupeds. And cans of Coke. And Mandelbrot sets...

Llamatron was written for the Atari ST, but I only ever played a version
for MS-DOS, and apparently this an erstaz version, although I do not recall
where I read that.

### Super Monkey Ball 2

*   available for: Nintendo GameCube
*   controls: analog joystick
*   genre: Maze-Runner
*   wikipedia: [Super Monkey Ball 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball_2)

I didn't think I'd like this one, since I really don't like those wooden
mazes that you tilt with the two dials — which is essentially what this
game is. But somehow it manages to be fun. Especially when you start
barrelling down a spiral, completely out of control. The party games I could
mostly do without, with the exception of racing, which is at least as fun
as the main game.

Some students had borrowed a video projector from the lab, and hooked it
up to their GameCube.  I played this on it, projected on the wall.
IMAX style.  It was vertigo-inducing.
