Recollected Games
=================

*   schema: Recollected game
*   status: permanently under construction

These are games which are possibly not remarkable enough nor classic enough
to be put in one of the other lists, but which I have memories of playing
(or at least seeing) regardless, and I'd like to note those memories somewhere.

This list is kind of a grab bag and will possibly never be as well organized
as the other lists.  There is a good chance any particular entry here will
move to some other list.

Commodore 64
------------

Some of these aren't totally Commodore 64-specific, and had conversions
on (or were a conversion from) other systems.

### Paradroid

*   wikipedia: [Paradroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradroid)
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=1888)

It's a C64 classic.  This did eventually get converted to other systems, but
not "the usual contemporaries" of the C64; Wikipedia treats it as "a C64 game" rather than
"an 8-bit game with ports C64 and other systems".

### The Castles of Dr. Creep

*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=428)

This is more of a puzzle game than a video game.

### Zig Zag

Not to be confused with [a different game called Zig Zag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_Zag_(video_game))
which was also available for the C64.

### Big Mac: The Mad Maintenance Man

Obviously influenced by Jumpman.  It's Jumpman with spells and a construction
kit, really.  Not that that's bad, at all.

### Cauldron II

The graphics are really good.

Well, it's got a dinosaur in a bathtub, that's for sure.

Commodore 64 Type-Ins
---------------------

### Crossroads

*   published by: COMPUTE! Publications Inc.
*   available for: Commodore 64
*   date released: 1987
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=4094)

This was a type-in game that appeared in
[Compute! Gazette Issue 54](https://archive.org/details/1987-12-computegazette),
December 1987.

This is possibly one of the best type-in games to ever have appeared in a magazine.

### Lava Flow

*   video @ [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jINbX-RH2Yk)

This was a type-in game that appeared in
[Compute! Gazette Issue 63](https://archive.org/details/1988-09-computegazette),
September 1988.

It's interesting because the lava works like a cellular automaton, a bit.

### Hovver Bovver

Didn't realize "bovver" was "bother" until I was older.

Need a Llamasoft section.

### Congo Bongo

*   entry @ [atarimania](http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-5200-congo-bongo_s11727.html)

Here is what is notable about Congo Bongo: the arcade game uses
[isometric projection][], but the C64 conversion and other
conversions use [oblique projection][], while the SG-1000
conversion uses [orthographic projection][], i.e. "side view",
i.e. it's just plain two-dimensional.

Which raises the aesthetic question: at what point does the game stop being Congo Bongo?

*   video @ [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nP5xKoObu4)

An omnidirectional scroller in space where you get to
shoot out the spherical pods of those [Benzene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene)-shaped
space stations.

The first arcade game to offer a "continue?" option, apparently.

### Bomb Jack

I remember seeing it in Portugal.

You can jump really, really high!

### Springer

I remember seeing it in an airport in Mexico.

### Lasso

### Bubbles

I thought it was cute when I saw it.

#### To Research

Arcade - Less obscure, possibly classic, games
----------------------------------------------

### Burgertime

This is probably a classic.

### Reactor

This is arguably a classic.

### Scramble

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.arcade-museum.com/images%252F118%252F1181242158130.png)

*   published by: Konami
*   date released: 1981
*   wikipedia: [Scramble (video game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_(video_game))
*   entry @ [arcade-museum.com](https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9447)

in which bombing the enemy's fuel tanks somehow results in you having *more* fuel.
This game mechanic would certainly be ridiculed as a "lack of realism" if this game
were written today. But the fact is, suspension of disbelief is suspension of disbelief,
and it keeps the game moving.

### Cloak & Dagger

*   genre: Shoot-'em-Up
*   available for: Arcade
*   controls: dual joystick
*   wikipedia: [Cloak & Dagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloak_%26_Dagger_(video_game))
*   video @ [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OryQRZ6Ez8)

There's something that's always attracted me about being able to shoot out
bits of wall. The boxes and conveyor belts hold a similar draw. Not sure if
I can put my finger on exactly what it is, though.

I remember seeing this at a 7-11 near where my sister was living at the time.

Notable for the fact that there was a tie-in with the movie of the same name,
which featured a home console (Atari 5200) version of this game... which was
never finished, despite the fact that the movie was a commercial success.

### Mr. Do

*   available for: Arcade
*   controls: joystick and one button

This is probably a classic.

### Gorf

This is probably a classic.

### Wizard of Wor

This is probably a classic.

MS-DOS

### Cyberbykes

*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbykes

I remember discovering a secret area you could jump to on one level (I think it
was "Warwickshire"?), but I don't remember if I ever successfully jumped to it...

### Stunts

Worth noting.

### Magic Carpet

*   published by: Bullfrog

Worth noting.

### Pinball Fantasies

Not sure if worth noting.

Console / 16-bit and above
--------------------------

### Katamari Damacy

*   published by: Namco
*   genre: Maze-Runner (nominally)
*   available for: Sony PlayStation
*   controls: dual analog joystick
*   wikipedia: [Katamari Damacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy)

An extremely original game — sort of a four-dimensional maze game where the
fourth dimension is scale. Rolling things up is also surprisingly satisfying
and disturbingly addictive. To top it all off, the soundtrack can't be beat.

### Typhoon Thompson

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.atarimagazines.com/st-log%252Fissue29%252F35-3.jpg)

*   written by: Dan Gorlin
*   published by: Brøderbund
*   genre: Shoot-'em'-Up (nominally)
*   available for: Amiga 500, Atari ST
*   controls: mouse and keyboard
*   date released: 1988
*   wikipedia: [Typhoon Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Thompson)

Quite possibly the cutest game ever.

Not actually a shoot-'em-up, as the author pointed out in his interview for
[Halcyon Days](http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/GORLIN.HTM):

> I like it because it's unique, the gameplay is simple but infinitely
> variable, and for me the characters really come to life. Some people
> mistook it for a shooter at the time, but it's really more like a game
> of Blitzkrieg Chess. If you just start blasting you lose immediately.
> Each kind of enemy has moves it can make, and the player has his moves,
> but things never happen the same way twice. It's not high concept in
> the way that "Choplifter" is, but rather a kind of art piece.

### Llamatron

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.atarimania.com/st%252Fscreens%252Fllamatron_llamasoft_6.gif)

*   written by: Jeff Minter
*   genre: Shoot-'em'-Up
*   available for: Atari ST, Amiga, MS-DOS
*   controls: joystick and 1 button
*   date released: 1991
*   wikipedia: [Llamatron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llamatron)

Fast-paced, psychedaelic, mindless fun, like most Jeff Minter games.
Basically a clone of the arcade game Robotron, but with shaggy, smelly
quadrupeds. And cans of Coke. And Mandelbrot sets...

Llamatron was written for the Atari ST, but I only ever played a version
for MS-DOS, and apparently this an erstaz version, although I do not recall
where I read that.

### Super Monkey Ball 2

*   genre: Maze-Runner
*   available for: Nintendo GameCube
*   controls: analog joystick
*   wikipedia: [Super Monkey Ball 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball_2)

I didn't think I'd like this one, since I really don't like those wooden
mazes that you tilt with the two dials — which is essentially what this
game is. But somehow it manages to be fun. Especially when you start
barrelling down a spiral, completely out of control. The party games I could
mostly do without, with the exception of racing, which is at least as fun
as the main game.

Some students had borrowed a video projector from the lab, and hooked it
up to their GameCube.  I played this on it, projected on the wall.
IMAX style.  It was vertigo-inducing.

Licensed Characters
-------------------

Many of the ones in "Games Based on British Television" used licensed characters.

### Licensed Character Games

*   Spot (7-Up mascot) (NES)
*   Fido (7-Up mascot) (??) (NES)
*   The Noid (Domino's Pizza mascot) (NES)
*   Garfield (NES)  (Apparently it was awful.)
*   Road Runner (arcade game)
*   Kool-Aid (starring Kool-Aid man) (Atari 2600)
*   There were actually a [huge number of Asterix and Obelix video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Asterix_games#Video_games).
