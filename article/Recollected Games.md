Recollected Games
=================

*   schema: Recollected game

These are games which are possibly not remarkable enough nor classic enough
to be put in one of the other lists, but which I have memories of playing
(or at least seeing) regardless, and I'd like to note those memories somewhere.

This list is kind of a grab bag and will possibly never be as well organized
as the other lists.  There is a good chance any particular entry here will
move to some other list.

### Ninja Warrior

Here is what is notable about Congo Bongo: the arcade game uses
[isometric projection][], but the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, and some other
conversions use [oblique projection][], while the SG-1000
conversion uses [orthographic projection][], i.e. "side view",
i.e. it's just plain two-dimensional.

Which raises the aesthetic question: at what point does the game stop being Congo Bongo?

### Springer

*   play online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/arcade_springer)

I remember seeing it in an airport in Mexico.

### Lasso

*   available for: Arcade

I remember seeing it in an airport in Mexico.

Doesn't appear to be on the Internet Archive.

### Bubbles

I thought it was cute when I saw it.

### Black Widow

For a long time, this was rather cryptically identified on this list only as the "spider eat grubsteak game".

### Cyberbykes

I remember discovering a secret area you could jump to on one level (I think it
was "Warwickshire"?), but I don't remember if I ever successfully jumped to it...

### Stunts

Worth noting.

### Magic Carpet

Developed by the same folks who developed Populous, and has some Populous-like
game mechanics in it, while being more or less an entirely different game.

Console / 16-bit and above

### Katamari Damacy

*   available for: Sony PlayStation
*   controls: dual analog joystick
*   genre: Maze-Runner (nominally)
*   published by: Namco
*   wikipedia: [Katamari Damacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy)

An extremely original game — sort of a four-dimensional maze game where the
fourth dimension is scale. Rolling things up is also surprisingly satisfying
and disturbingly addictive. To top it all off, the soundtrack can't be beat.

### Typhoon Thompson

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.atarimagazines.com/st-log%252Fissue29%252F35-3.jpg)

*   available for: Amiga 500, Atari ST
*   controls: mouse and keyboard
*   date released: 1988
*   genre: Shoot-'em-Up (nominally)
*   published by: Brøderbund
*   wikipedia: [Typhoon Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Thompson)
*   written by: Dan Gorlin

Quite possibly the cutest game ever.

Not actually a shoot-'em-up, as the author pointed out in his interview for
[Halcyon Days](http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/GORLIN.HTM):

> I like it because it's unique, the gameplay is simple but infinitely
> variable, and for me the characters really come to life. Some people
> mistook it for a shooter at the time, but it's really more like a game
> of Blitzkrieg Chess. If you just start blasting you lose immediately.
> Each kind of enemy has moves it can make, and the player has his moves,
> but things never happen the same way twice. It's not high concept in
> the way that "Choplifter" is, but rather a kind of art piece.

### Super Monkey Ball 2

*   available for: Nintendo GameCube
*   controls: analog joystick
*   genre: Maze-Runner
*   wikipedia: [Super Monkey Ball 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball_2)

I didn't think I'd like this one, since I really don't like those wooden
mazes that you tilt with the two dials — which is essentially what this
game is. But somehow it manages to be fun. Especially when you start
barrelling down a spiral, completely out of control. The party games I could
mostly do without, with the exception of racing, which is at least as fun
as the main game.

Some students had borrowed a video projector from the lab, and hooked it
up to their GameCube.  I played this on it, projected on the wall.
IMAX style.  It was vertigo-inducing.

Llamasoft

### Llamatron

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.atarimania.com/st%252Fscreens%252Fllamatron_llamasoft_6.gif)

*   available for: Atari ST, Amiga, MS-DOS
*   controls: joystick and 1 button
*   date released: 1991
*   genre: Shoot-'em'-Up
*   wikipedia: [Llamatron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llamatron)
*   written by: Jeff Minter

Fast-paced, psychedaelic, mindless fun, like most Jeff Minter games.
Basically a clone of the arcade game Robotron, but with shaggy, smelly
quadrupeds. And cans of Coke. And Mandelbrot sets...

Llamatron was written for the Atari ST, but I only ever played a version
for MS-DOS, and apparently this an erstaz version, although I do not recall
where I read that.

### Hovver Bovver

*   genre: Collect the dots
*   wikipedia: [Hovver Bovver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hover_Bovver)
*   written by: Jeff Minter

I didn't realize "bovver" was supposed to be "bother" until a very, very
long time after I first saw this game.
