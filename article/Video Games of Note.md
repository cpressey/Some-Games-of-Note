Video Games of Note
===================

*   schema: Video game
*   status: permanently under construction

I originally compiled this list (as a list of my favourite games) because
I figured that if [Wouter could have such a page](http://strlen.com/rants/fav_games.html),
then I could too.  I've also been told that I have good taste in video games.

It has since become somewhat generalized from being a list of favourite games
to a list of games [of note](A%20Note%20on%20Items%20of%20Note.md).

Gameplay generally counts more than the quality of the graphics or sound
effects or music, but the latter elements sometimes have their part to play
in making a really notable game.  "Realism" of the game is generally not
a factor.

These are ordered from most impressive to me to least impressive.  Note, however,
that the order and contents of this list are subject to change.

This list is mostly arcade games.  Games for home systems have intentionally
been offloaded to articles dedicated to the particular system:

*   [Commodore 64 Games of Note](Commodore%2064%20Games%20of%20Note.md)
*   [Apple II Games of Note](Apple%20II%20Games%20of%20Note.md)

### Typhoon Thompson

*   written by: Dan Gorlin
*   published by: Brøderbund
*   genre: Shoot-'em'-Up (nominally)
*   available for: Amiga 500, Atari ST
*   controls: mouse and keyboard
*   date released: 1988
*   wikipedia: [Typhoon Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Thompson)

Quite possibly the cutest game ever.

Not actually a shoot-'em-up, as the author pointed out in his interview for
[Halcyon Days](http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/GORLIN.HTM):

> I like it because it's unique, the gameplay is simple but infinitely

> Each kind of enemy has moves it can make, and the player has his moves,

> the way that "Choplifter" is, but rather a kind of art piece.

### Pepper II

To the untrained eye, it's a ripoff of Pac-Man: fill in all the regions
instead of eat all the dots. But there's something about it that sets it
apart — maybe it's that the action is more frenetic and somehow smoother
(if slightly buggier,) maybe it's because the strategy is different
(more emphasis on getting the power-ups just to stay alive.)

### City Connection

A jumping minivan? Yes, a jumping minivan. And European paddywagons. And a
devil-cat-thing with a checkered flag. And a balloon that warps you to
other cities. How can you not love it?

Not sure if it's truly a platformer, though.

### Lost Tomb

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.arcade-museum.com/images%252F118%252F118124212725.png)

*   genre: Shoot-'em'-Up
*   available for: Arcade
*   controls: dual joystick
*   date released: 1982
*   entry @ [arcade-museum](https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8456)

Gnarly game, but very hard. I especially liked the 3D effect on the
intermediate levels with the staircases. (Even though it's awkward to control
and far too easy to die on these.) The "word from our sponsor" interruptions
are also quite cute.

There is something coherent and unified about the design of this game that
you don't often see in other games; you get the impression that it was crafted
rather than simply produced.

Well, maybe I'm overstating it a bit, but you get the idea.

### Looping

In this game, your goal is to pilot an airplane over some terrain
and then through a field of obstacles — inside a maze, essentially.
This is made more complicated by the fact that you can only change
direction in an arc.  You can also shoot out some bits of the world
when they get in your way, and in fact you have to in some places.

Oh, and also, if you fly too high up, you bounce off the sky.

The original ROM images for Looping have been made available for
free, non-commercial use.

### Liquid Kids

*   controls: joystick and 2 buttons
*   date released: 1990

*   entry @ [arcade-museum](https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8433)

Very cute. Quite possibly a sequel or pseudo-sequel to The New Zealand Story,
since you play what appears to be a platypus, and there are oblique references
to TNZS (in one of the secret chambers, the platforms are arranged in the
shape of the kiwi.)

### The New Zealand Story

"This game is dedicated to all maze fans." However, that should not deter
fans of: kiwis, archery, flying machines shaped like bears' heads, laser
pistols, magical fireball-belching staffs, and the like.

### Llamatron

![screenshot](https://static.catseye.tc/archive/www.atarimania.com/st%252Fscreens%252Fllamatron_llamasoft_6.gif)

*   written by: Jeff Minter
*   genre: Shoot-'em'-Up
*   available for: Atari ST, Amiga, MS-DOS
*   controls: joystick and 1 button
*   date released: 1991
*   wikipedia: [Llamatron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llamatron)

Fast-paced, psychedaelic, mindless fun, like most Jeff Minter games.
Basically a clone of the arcade game Robotron, but with shaggy, smelly
quadrupeds. And cans of Coke. And Mandelbrot sets...

Llamatron was written for the Atari ST, but I only ever played a version
for MS-DOS, and apparently this an erstaz version, although I do not recall
where I read that.
