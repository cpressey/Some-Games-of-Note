Beautiful graphics.  I believe the antagonists were implemented with "soft sprites"
(groups of programmable characters), so that all(?) 8 hardware sprites were free to
be used for the protagonist in a composite fashion that is both hi-res and
multicolour.  The music is also good.  The game itself is quite hard.

### Pharaoh's Curse

It's difficult to say what contributes to this game's overall charm.

You can shoot the mummy, but the mummy can shoot back.

The triggers trigger traps on a delay which is perfectly predictable, so it
adds a nice element of timing to the game.

Also: the bird!

### Necromancer

It's a good example of a game which combines fast-pacing with variety
while maintaining coherence across the variety.  The Wikipedia article
explains it better than I can.

### Zeppelin

Notable because you can shoot out bits of wall, or rather, bits of force field
and Futuristic Domed City, and in this way it feels a bit like an airborne
version of [Cloak & Dagger][].  Also notable because it involves flying a
dirigible in a cave.

Also notable for being a multi-directional scroller, but one in which you have
only limited influence over which direction it scrolls in.  Once you maneouver
to a particular point in the cave, the direction will change apropos to that
point.  You don't seem to be able to get into a dead-end this way, which is
probably good (much less frustrating than games in which you can,) but you
do seem to be able to go in circles quite easily.
