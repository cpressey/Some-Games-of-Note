Beautiful graphics.  I believe the antagonists were implemented with "soft sprites"
(groups of programmable characters), so that all(?) 8 hardware sprites were free to
be used for the protagonist in a composite fashion that is both hi-res and
multicolour.  The music is also good.  The game itself is quite hard.

### Pharaoh's Curse

It's difficult to say what contributes to this game's overall charm.

You can shoot the mummy, but the mummy can shoot back.

The triggers trigger traps on a delay which is perfectly predictable, so it
adds a nice element of timing to the game.

Also: the bird!

### Necromancer

It's a good example of a game which combines fast-pacing with variety
while maintaining coherence across the variety.  The Wikipedia article
explains it better than I can.

### Zeppelin

Notable because you can shoot out bits of wall, or rather, bits of force field
and Futuristic Domed City, and in this way it feels a bit like an airborne
version of [Cloak & Dagger][].  Also notable because it involves flying a
dirigible in a cave.

Also notable for being a multi-directional scroller, but one in which you have
only limited influence over which direction it scrolls in.  Once you maneouver
to a particular point in the cave, the direction will change apropos to that
point.  You don't seem to be able to get into a dead-end this way, which is
probably good (much less frustrating than games in which you can,) but you
do seem to be able to go in circles quite easily.

### Everyone's a Wally

If there was an award for Best Representation of a British High Street in an 8-bit Video Game,
this would be a contender.  It's worth noting that "being a wally" is British slang for
"being a fool" (approximately speaking).

There were also versions for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC but it's not clear to me
if the Commodore 64 version was a later port or if they were developed simultaneously.

### Slinky!

This one's pretty memorably weird, and deserves comment.

Once upon a time there was a game called Q*Bert which was quite famous and inspired a number of clones,
and each of these clones tended to have their own idiosyncratic mechanics.  And Slinky is one such clone.

The 2013-06-14 comment by zaphod77 on the Lemon64 entry linked to above explains those mechanics far
better than I could.  It does not, however, help them seem less arbitrary.  I don't think anything
could do that.

### Cauldron II

The graphics are really good.  The bounce-as-you-move mechanic is interesting,
but also a bit frustrating.  It's sometimes hard to visualize how the screens
connect.  It's a very hard game.  But the graphics are really good.

### Whistler's Brother

Notable for gameplay mechanic: the player controls one character directly
with a joystick, but also a second character indirectly, by influencing
where they go, by whistling for them.

However, despite this interesting mechanic, I must admit I never really
got into this game.  Something about it failed to appeal to me — perhaps
it was that the graphics felt kind of uninspired.

### Equinox

The internet thinks the [theme music for this game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Of28GGPUIY) was written
by Nick Jones, the main(?) developer of the C64 version of this game.  This is entirely possible.

However, I swear I've also heard this song on radio/muzak while I was in Paris, twice.  French synthpop?

It's entirely possible it was merely a similar tune, or that they are the same song but which came first?

Game-wise, it's an okay game.

### Starquake

Perhaps a classic, or perhaps not well-known enough to be a true classic, I'm not sure.

The graphics in the C64 version are really good.
