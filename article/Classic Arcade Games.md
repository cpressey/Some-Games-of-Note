Classic Arcade Games
====================

*   common available for: Arcade
*   schema: Video game

This is a list of video games that were seen in arcade cabinets
in public venues such as video arcades, supermarkets, and convenience stores.
Unlike "Arcade Games of Note", these were fairly well-known and recognized at the time.
Of course, some entries in both lists are disputable on that point.

### Scramble

in which bombing the enemy's fuel tanks somehow results in you having *more* fuel.
This game mechanic would certainly be ridiculed as a "lack of realism" if this game
were written today. But the fact is, suspension of disbelief is suspension of disbelief,
and it keeps the game moving.

### BurgerTime

This one is notable for the remarkably unhygienic method of
food preparation showcased in it.

There is a weird video effect (shared by Wizard of Wor, below) that I should
try to research or at least describe here someday.

### Wizard of Wor

There's something that's always attracted me about being able to shoot out
bits of wall. The boxes and conveyor belts hold a similar draw. Not sure if
I can put my finger on exactly what it is, though.

I remember seeing this at a 7-11 near where my sister was living at the time.

Notable for the fact that there was a tie-in with the movie of the same name,
which featured a home console (Atari 5200) version of this game... which was
never finished, despite the fact that the movie was a commercial success.

### Mr. Do!

What an voluminous set of rules there is in this game.  There are four
seperate ways to pass a level, for instance.

### Reactor

*   published by: Gottlieb
*   available for: Arcade

*   wikipedia: [Reactor_(video_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_(video_game))
*   play online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/arcade_reactor)

This is arguably a classic.  The first video game to credit the developer (Tim Skelly) on the title screen, apparently.

### Bosconian

An omnidirectional scroller in space where you get to
shoot out the spherical pods of those [Benzene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene)-shaped
space stations.

The first arcade game to offer a "continue?" option, apparently.

### Bomb Jack

*   published by: Tecmo

*   controls: joystick and 1 button
*   date released: 1984
*   wikipedia: [Bomb Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_Jack)

I remember seeing it (at a laundromat, I think) while my family was on vacation in Portugal.

You can jump really, really high!  You can also slow down your fall after jumping, and glide
horizontally, by pressing the jump button while falling.

As of this writing the Internet Archive does not have a playable version of it online.
However, it does have [Bomb Jack Twin](https://archive.org/details/arcade_bjtwin) playable
online, which has very similar mechanics (but different, more sophisticated graphics, as
well as 2-player simultaneous mode.)
