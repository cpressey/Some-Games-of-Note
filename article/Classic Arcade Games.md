Classic Arcade Games
====================

*   common available for: Arcade
*   schema: Video game

This is a list of video games that were seen in arcade cabinets
in public venues such as video arcades, supermarkets, and convenience stores.
Unlike "Arcade Games of Note", these were fairly well-known and recognized at the time.
Of course, some entries in both lists are disputable on that point.

### Scramble

in which bombing the enemy's fuel tanks somehow results in you having *more* fuel.
This game mechanic would certainly be ridiculed as a "lack of realism" if this game
were written today. But the fact is, suspension of disbelief is suspension of disbelief,
and it keeps the game moving.

### BurgerTime

*   published by: Data East

*   video @ [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OryQRZ6Ez8)

There's something that's always attracted me about being able to shoot out
bits of wall. The boxes and conveyor belts hold a similar draw. Not sure if
I can put my finger on exactly what it is, though.

I remember seeing this at a 7-11 near where my sister was living at the time.

Notable for the fact that there was a tie-in with the movie of the same name,
which featured a home console (Atari 5200) version of this game... which was
never finished, despite the fact that the movie was a commercial success.

### Mr. Do!

*   published by: Universal
*   available for: Arcade
*   controls: joystick and one button
*   date released: 1982

This is probably a classic.

### Reactor

*   available for: Arcade
*   controls: trackball
*   date released: 1982
*   wikipedia: [Reactor_(video_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_(video_game))

This is arguably a classic.  The first video game to credit the developer (Tim Skelly) on the title screen, apparently.

### Bosconian

An omnidirectional scroller in space where you get to
shoot out the spherical pods of those [Benzene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene)-shaped
space stations.

The first arcade game to offer a "continue?" option, apparently.

### Bomb Jack

You can jump really, really high!
