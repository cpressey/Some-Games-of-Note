British TV-Derived Games of Note
================================

*   schema: Video game

This is a list of 8-bit video games [of note](A%20Note%20on%20Items%20of%20Note.md),
specifically ones which were based on content from British television productions.

Many of these games are notable not because they are good, but solely because
of their origin in Brit TV.  However, even the terrible ones occasionally do have
some redeeming characteristics.

### The Prisoner
