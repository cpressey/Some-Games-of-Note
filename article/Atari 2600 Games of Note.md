Atari 2600 Games of Note
========================

*   common available for: Atari 2600
*   schema: Video game

This list is an offshoot of video games [of note](A%20Note%20on%20Items%20of%20Note.md)
which specifically lists games for that 6502-based home system, the Atari 2600 VCS.

These are arguably all classics instead of merely games "of note", but if so,
they are somewhat on the obscure side of "classic".

### Haunted House

As the TVTropes article says, this is possibly the ur-survival-horror game.
The game uses invisibility to good effect — just because an object
exists at a certain location doesn't mean it has to be drawn on the screen.

The "font" in which the digits of the score are rendered is also nice, but
I suppose that's minor.

### Adventure

Notable for at least two things: one, it was an attempt to "graphicalize" a text adventure;
that is, the author wanted to translate [Colossal Cave][] to a graphical interface.  And two,
apparently it is the first game containing an Easter Egg (or at least, the first to popularize
this notion.)

### Yars' Revenge

This ends up being a very good game, despite being quite simple, probably because the gameplay
is varied and balanced, despite being quite simple.  In this vein,
it's been [analyzed as a microsport](http://metopal.com/2013/08/08/yars-revenge-as-microsport/).

It's also notable for the early use of a "glitch art"-like effect: the neutral
zone is indicated with visual noise which is actually the 6502 machine code of the
game itself, being displayed on the screen as if it were a bitmap.
